  <h1>The exposure triangle in photography is explained for beginners</h1>
  </center>

	<p>The exposure triangle is one of the best analogies to understand the photography basics that affect exposure: 
	aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, and how they interact with each other.In this beginner’s guide to the exposure triangle, 
	you’ll find the exposure triangle in photography explained. </p>
	 
  
<li> <strong>Shutter Speed </strong>- the amount of time a camera's shutter remains open to allow light to enter
	  the camera sensor.Shutter speeds are typically measured in fractions of a second when they are 
	  under a second. Slow shutter speeds allow light into the camera sensor and are used for low-light 
	  and night photography, while fast shutter speeds help to freeze motion. Examples of shutter 
	  speeds: 1/15 (1/15th of a second), 1/30, 1/60, 1/125.</li>
	  
	  <li><strong>Aperture</strong> - a hole within a lens that allows light to enter the camera body.The larger the
	  hole, the lighter it passes to the camera sensor. Aperture also controls the depth of field, which
	  is the portion of a scene that appears to be sharp. If the aperture is very small, the depth of field 
	  is large, while if the aperture is very large,the depth of field is small. In photography, aperture is 
	  typically expressed in "f" numbers (also known as "focal ratio") since the f-number is the ratio of the 
	  diameter of the lens aperture to the length of the lens. Examples of f-numbers are: f/1.4, f/2.0, f/2.8,
	  f/4.0, f/5.6, f/8.0.</li>
	  
	  <li><strong>ISO </strong>– a way to brighten your photos if you can’t use a longer shutter speed or a wider aperture. 
	  It is typically measured in numbers, with a lower number representing a darker image, while higher 
	  numbers mean a brighter image. However, raising your ISO comes at a cost. As the ISO rises, so does 
	  the visibility of graininess and noise in your images. Examples of ISO: 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600.</li>
